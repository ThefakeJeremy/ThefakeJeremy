I'm just a guy who likes to code in C++(/Python? <sub>don't really code in it anymore.</sub>) and never finishes his projects. I mostly have interest in game/app development <sub>([Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) my beloved, Pygame for Python though. Who needs a app library when those two exist! (I don't want to learn a new library + the app libraries are hard, okay...? ): )</sub>

<sub>Well uh, a little update: I do not work on anything anymore because no ideas on what to do.</sub>

You can find me on [Bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/thefakejeremy.bsky.social), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Historical-Study-223/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/thefakejeremy) and contact me there if needed.
